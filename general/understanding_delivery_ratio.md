## understanding:delivery ratio

**understanding:delivery** is an attempt from my side to quantify the **quality** of a session/lecture/seminar/tutorial.

It simply states that -  
> **Quality of a Session** = **Concepts Understood** by the Attendee(s) / **Concepts Delivered** in the Session.

The highest value that can be achieved in this ratio is *1*.  
So if a session addresses 5 concepts while the attendee(s) are only able to understand 4, then:  
Quality of Session = 4/5  
=> **0.8**

#### Assumptions required in calculating understanding:delivery ratio
1. We are assuming that the attendees meet the minimum requisites of attending the session.
1. We assume that the mode/language of delivery of lecture is easily comprehensible by each attendee.
1. We mark a concept as understood if more than 75% of the class strength understood the concept.  
This factor can be increased further to improve quality.
1. The session is being completed in the designated time. The time utilized in doubt clearing can be discounted. 


Let make the ratio more realistic.  
We need to be concrete about what understanding a concept means in real life.  
Understanding should further be broken down into more detailed subpoints, to be quantitative.

To make it simpler, we assume that we have just one attendee and build the question framework around him/her.
1. Is the attendee able to recall what was presented in the session ?
1. Is the attendee able to explain it to others, the same concept

## understanding:delivery ratio

**understanding:delivery** is an attempt from my side to quantify the **quality** of a session/lecture/seminar/tutorial.

It simply states that -  
> **Quality of a Session(_&#968;_)** = **Concepts Understood** by the Attendee(s) / **Concepts Delivered(_&#961;_)** in the Session.

The highest value that can be achieved in this ratio is *1*.  
So if a session addresses 5 concepts while the attendee(s) are only able to understand 4, then:  
Quality of Session = 4/5  
=> **_&#968;_ = 0.8**

#### Assumptions required in calculating understanding:delivery ratio
1. We are assuming that the attendees meet the minimum requisites of attending the session.
1. We assume that the mode/language of delivery of lecture is easily comprehensible by each attendee.
1. We mark a concept as understood if more than 75% of the class strength understood the concept.  
This factor can be increased further to improve quality.
1. The session is being completed in the designated time. The time utilized in doubt clearing can be discounted. 
1. The attendee is hearing about the concept for the first time, and doesn't have any previous knowledge related to the concept being discussed.

Let make the ratio more realistic.  

Concepts delivered is pretty straight-forward.  
It depends on what all logical units the presenter of the content breaks it into.  
Kindly note that it is the presenter who would decide how to logically break the content into well defined concepts.  
Hence,  
> Concepts Delivered (_&#961;_) = Number of Logical Units defined by the Presenter

We need to be concrete about what understanding a concept means.  
Understanding is a very subjective term.
Understanding should further be broken down into more detailed subpoints, to be quantitative.

To make it simpler, we assume that we have just one attendee and just one concept and build the question framework around him/her.
1. Is the attendee able to recall the content of the concept presented in the session? (Weightage : 1)
1. Is the attendee able to explain the same concept to others? (Weightage : 2)
1. Is the attendee able to apply the concept immediately after the session has been delivered? (Weightage : 2)

Hence, when we talk about a single concept:
> Understanding Concept(_&#951;_) = Weightage Scored by the Attendee in a Concept / Total Weightage of Subpoints of Understanding

And when we extend the definition to multiple concepts:
> Understanding Concepts = _&Sigma;_ (_&#951;_)


So with the above factors in mind, we can conceive a new improved defintion of Quality of Session

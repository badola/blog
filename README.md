## Remember Remember the Rule of Five

### C++
C++ is powerful yet obnoxious for beginners. I had a hard time to get it to work as per what I find amusing. It dawns too late, with a language like C++, that programming can be fun.
But for those who are sufferring there with C++, hang in there. It will be fun, after 10 years.
After 10 years, you will have a statically typed language at your disposal with type-safety as your guard.

So **why** should I write this blog ?

There are a lot of things that I amuse me from other languages, which I wished was there in C++.
They are there, but the construction is generally awkward and hard to grasp.
I would try to make things simple, for everyone, especially for _future me_.

So **how** should I write this blog?

A tutorial that is lucid.
So that I can refer it myself in the future and understand.
A tutorial that can be shared with others, to help them understand concepts.

So **what** should be in this blog ?

Compare features from other languages, that are amusingly easy to use.
Think of how to write the same in a strong typed, statically typed, type-safe language, mostly C++.
Write its C++ equivalent code, and then test it.
And then store it in a blog.

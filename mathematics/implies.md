**Implies** `=>` takes people by surprise when they learn about its working.

*Implies* `A => B` is the connective in propositional calculus which has the meaning `if A is true, then B is also true`  
But what happens when `A is false` ?

Well, the only hard ball to remember is when `A is false` then `A => B is true`.  
It doesn't matter if - B is possible or definitely wrong or anything.  
If `A` is false, `A=>B` is true.

There is an easy way to remember it.

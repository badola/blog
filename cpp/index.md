### C++
C++ is powerful yet obnoxious for beginners.  
Everyone had a hard time to get it to work as per what they find amusing.  
It dawns too late, with a language like C++, that programming can be fun.  
But for those who are sufferring there with C++, hang in there. It will be fun, after 10 years.  
After 10 years, you will have a statically typed language at your disposal with type-safety as your guard.  

So **why** should I write this blog ?

There are a lot of things, from languages other than C++, which amuse me and I wish were there in C++.  
They are there, but the construction is generally awkward and hard to grasp.  
I would try to make things simple, for everyone, especially for _future me_.

So **how** should I write this blog?

A tutorial that is lucid.  
So that I can refer it myself in the future and understand.  
A tutorial that can be shared with others, to help them understand concepts.

So **what** should be in this blog ?

Compare features from other languages, that are amusingly easy to use.  
Think of how to write the same in a strong typed, statically typed, type-safe language, mostly C++.  
Write its C++ equivalent code, and then test it.  
And then store it in a blog.
